## Limitations and future work

One of the simplifications we made was that the order of turns was fixed, after an agent unsuccessfully requested a card. Given that the results have shown that the order of turns matter, using a fixed order instead of a dynamic order is likely to have affected the results. Further research could compare these two situations to investigate this.


Another noteworthy limitation to our study was that we had eliminated the draw pile, which is often used when Quartets is played in real life. A draw pile would limit the knowledge advantage that agents that do not start have, while not directly limiting the advantage gained by going first. We expect the advantage of the first agent to increase in this scenario, but an experiment to confirm our suspicion is outside the scope of this project.

A third possible direction of research could be to investigate whether there could be any strategic advantage for an agent to ask for a card it already owns. In our project, we have disallowed agents to do this, although it is possible that there would be value in allowing agents to do so.
