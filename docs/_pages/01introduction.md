## Research Question
In the card game quartets, the goal is obviously to win, which is done by getting as many quartets as possible. There are different strategies to do this. One simple strategy would be to simply ask for a random card that you need from a random other agent. A smarter player will use logic to deduce which cards other people do and do not have, and use this to their advantage. A player can then also decide to use either a defensive or an aggressive strategy, where they play either for their own interest or to sabotage other players who are doing well.

Our goal in this project is to find out how to win. The strategies of the players obviously influence who will win. However, another thing that influences who wins is the player that begins and the order in which they play. Our research question is "Which strategy gives the highest chance to win and how much does the play order influence the chance to win?".



<!-- For our project we have modelled the card game quartets. This is a game played by children from a young age, as it is quite easy to explain and understand. Using this website, we will explain how the game is played, how it is relevant to the course LAMAS, how we have implemented the game and any simplifications to the original game.
